	<p>As your humble servant, a humanoid robot "Kara" can do some common household tasks for you, like boiling carrot or making coffee. Recently, Kara sometimes makes mistakes, due to some unknown reasons. After reading the user manual and making observations, you find that there is something wrong with both Kara's vision module and task planning module. <b>As two separate modules, you know that they go wrong at a different, unknown probability and the probability does not change.</b></p>

	<p>Before taking Kara to the store and wait for several weeks to get a replacement, you want to see whether you can repair it yourself. The user manual tells you that Kara is equipped with the cutting-edge self-repair technology. If the error rate of a module is less than 0.40, Kara can repair that module automatically without your help. Errors which occur more frequently (with probability 0.40-0.69) are considered severe: you should replace the damaged component, before Kara can start its self-repair program to clean up the mess. Errors which often occur (with probability 0.70-0.99) are extremely dangerous: you have to send Kara for repair, otherwise it may disobey commands and harm the user. </p>

	<p>Fortunately, Kara records its recent activities and the output of both modules. Using a built-in diagnostic program, you can help Kara estimate the type of error. The program consists of several replay sessions: in each session, Kara tells you the task it is working on and displays a snapshot after an action. The diagnostic program also gives out explanations showing Kara's states (output of the vison module) or task plans (in terms of precondition and posteffect of an action). To save cost of communication, the program sometimes does not generate explanation for either module: a lack of explanation doesn't indicate the module is working or not.</p>

	<p>In the following replay sessions, you will indicate whether Kara's vision and task planning module are giving out wrong results, based on the snapshots and explanations. Modules can go wrong at the same time. If the vision module is not working, Kara sometimes fails to identify objects, their state changes and positions. For example, a buggy vision module may believe the plate is in the oven, while it is actually next to the oven. Broken task planning module let Kara do things irrelevant to the current task. For example, for the task "getting coffee", a buggy task planning module may generate irrelavant plans such as "taking an apple". Note that two modules are independent and do not affect each other.</p>
