	<p>In the pilot study, you are going to collaborate with a humanoid robot on common household tasks. The robot will do most of the work, while you are supposed to help the robot, by making choices using the provided web interface.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>The task you will now go through is <STRONG>making orange juice</STRONG>. </li>
		<li>During the process, robot will pause for several times (indicating that <STRONG>it needs your help</STRONG>). There are three stages of this experiment. You should start each stage by watching the video. At the first two stages, the robot needs your help.  The first two stages contain three parts. In the first part, you can <STRONG>ask robot some questions</STRONG> (by making choices, if available) to figure out the robotâ€™s task plan, the robot will respond with an explanation. If you don't want to ask more questions, you should choose "I don't want to ask anything". In the second part, we will have some questions for you to make sure that you understand the situation. In the third part,  you should help the robot by indicating an <STRONG>action</STRONG>.</li>
		<li> Note that not all the actions have positive effects, so be careful about what you are choosing. </li>
		
		<li> At the thrid stage, we will have an evaluation for you to help us assess the system.  </li>
	</ul>
