	<p>In the pilot study, you are going to collaborate with a humanoid robot on common household tasks. The robot will do most of the work, while you are supposed to help the robot, by making choices using the provided web interface.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>The task you will now go through is <STRONG>making orange juice</STRONG>. </li>
		<li>During the process, robot will initiate the communication channel for several times (indicating that <STRONG>it needs your help</STRONG>). Each time, you can <STRONG> first ask robot some questions</STRONG> (by making choices, if available) to figure out the robotâ€™s task plan. After that, you should help the robot by indicating an <STRONG>action</STRONG>.</li>
		<li> Note that not all the actions have positive effects, so be careful about what you are choosing. </li>
		<li> During the experiment, we will have some questions to help you make the choice.</li>
		<li> After the experiment, we will have an evaluation for you to help us assess the system.  </li>
	</ul>

	<p> During this experiment please do not hit <font color="red">refresh</font> button or <font color="red">"go back"</font> button, otherwise the data we collected will become <font color="red">void</font> </p>
