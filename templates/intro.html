	<p>In the pilot study, you are going to collaborate with a humanoid robot on common household tasks. The robot will do most of the work, while you are supposed to help the robot, by making choices using the provided web interface.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>The task you will now go through is <STRONG>making orange juice</STRONG>. </li>
		<li>During the process, there are several stages in which the robot needs your help. You should start each stage by watching a video. After that, you can:
			<ol> 
				<li> <STRONG> ask robot some questions </STRONG> (if available) and get an idea of what it is trying to do </li>
				<li> <STRONG> answer some questions</STRONG>  we prepared for you. </li>
				<li> finally, help the robot by indicating an action (based on your knowledge of the robot and the environment) </li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li> Note that not all the actions have positive effects, so be careful about what you are choosing. </li>
		
	</ul>
