	<p>In the pilot study, you are going to collaborate with a humanoid robot on common household tasks. The robot will do most of the work, and you will help the robot by making choices using the provided web interface.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>The task you will now go through is <STRONG>making orange juice</STRONG>. </li>
		<li>During the process, there are several stages in which the robot needs your help. Each stage starts with a video clip. After watching the video, you will:
			<ol> 
				<li> <STRONG> ask the robot some questions </STRONG> (if available) and get an idea of what it is trying to do. </li>
				<li> <STRONG> answer some questions</STRONG>  we prepared for you. </li>
				<li> finally, help the robot by indicating an action (based on your knowledge of the robot and the environment) </li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li> Be careful when you choose an action, as they have different effects (positive or negative) on the robot. </li>
		
	</ul>

	<p> During this experiment please do not hit <font color="red">refresh</font> button or <font color="red">"go back"</font> button, otherwise the data we collected will become <font color="red">void</font> </p>
